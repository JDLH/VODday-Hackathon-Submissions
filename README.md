##Vancouver Open Data Day Challenge

We didn't particularly focus on the [2017 VODday Challenges](https://www.opendatabc.ca/pages/2017-vodday-vancouver-open-data-day#challenges).*



##Prototype Problem Statement

My vision is that apps based on Vancouver open data should be localised into all the languages in which Vancouver residents want them. 

Over [30% of the people in the Vancouver region speak a language other than English at home](http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/as-sa/fogs-spg/Facts-cma-eng.cfm?LANG=Eng&GK=CMA&GC=933), says Stats Canada. That is over 700,000 people of the 2.9m people in the area. Now of course localising those apps and web sites is a task for the developer. My discipline, internationalisation (i18n), is a set of design and implementation techniques to make it cheaper and easier to localise an app or web site. At some point, an app or web site presents data sourced from an open data dataset. 

In order for the complete user experience to be localised, the dataset also needs to be localised. A challenge of enabling localisation of open data-sourced apps is to set up formats, social structures, and incentive structures which makes it easier for datasets to get localised into the languages which matter to the end users.

To that end, I picked a modest project for the day. It was to make a [language census of the city of Vancouverâ€™s Open Data datasets](http://wiki.opendataday.org/Vancouver_Open_Data_language_census). The link is to a project page I started on the Open Data Day wiki. 

However, the [Vancouver Open Datasets catalogue](http://data.vancouver.ca/datacatalogue/index.htm) is published as an HTML table. It is difficult to copy this table and process it with software. So, the first problem to solve was converting this catalogue into a standard, machine-readable format.

##Protoype Summary
*Summarize your approach to addressing the challenge. Highlight the value of your approach to addressing the challenge, who your inteded users are, and the long term vision.*



##Open Data Sets
###What Open Data Sets Will You Use?
*What open data sets, standards, OpenAPI's etc does your prototype draw on? How does it use them?*

 - List them here...
 
 

###What Open Data Sets Do You Still Need?
*Identify open data sets that are not yet available, but would benifit or are needed for the project. Explain how you would use the data to improve your prototype and address the challenge.*

*This is your chance to form a mini business case for the data you need to share with open data providers!*
